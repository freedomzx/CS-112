split array between spaces
go through all of the tokens
  for each token check if there's a letter
    if there's a letter take note of where the letter is
    after looking for a letter look for brackets
    if you have both, then there's an array to be worked with
      look for the name of the array then add it into arrays
    if you only have letterPlace then its just a variable
      add the variable in after looking for the name of the variables
should be good? we are confused on how tokenizer actually works though
